# 3DP_homeworks
Homeworks submission for the course 3D Data Processing, UNIPD, all achieving full marks.

## HW1 - Stereo Matching
Create the disparity map for a pair of stereo images by looking for corresponding pixels that are the projections of the same 3D point, taking advantage of the epipolar constraint that limits the search to 1 dimension.

## HW2 - Structure from motion
Estimation of the 3D structure of a small scene using a sequence of images taken by a phone that have field of view overlap with each other.

## HW3 - Iterative Closest Point
Find the transformation that aligns a source point cloud to the target.

## HW4 - 3D Deep Descriptors
Design a modified version of the PointNet architecture that is able to extract 3D descriptors, which will be used for matching.
